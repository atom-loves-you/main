## Verse 1

Rainy day stash, sugar tax  
Stuck in the slow pass  
Sugar crash, good to see you  
Come get your money, babe

## Verse 2

Caught up in the hum, hum, hum  
That's just how it goes, babe  
Celebrate all his shouting  
Turns to hum, hum, hum

## Chorus

Windows fogged up, sigh so deep  
Whispers turn to hum, sleep, sleep, sleep  
That's just how it goes, babe  
Moments pass, we ride that wave

## Bridge

Sugar crash, and I'm almost feeling plain  
Hum, hum, hum, it's all the same  
Steps we take, they fade away  
Hum, hum, hum, it's just a game

## Verse 3

Raindrop hits the window, pain  
Slow descent, a silent lane  
Sugar crash, we're in the flow  
Hum, hum, hum, it's how we go

## Chorus

Windows fogged up, sigh so deep  
Whispers turn to hum, sleep, sleep, sleep  
That's just how it goes, babe  
Moments pass, we ride that wave

"Sugar Crash," written and performed by Khristin Schenk, explores themes of monotony, fleeting moments, and the cyclical nature of life's highs and lows.

### **Breakdown of the song's lyrics and meanings:**

Verse 1  
"Rainy day stash sugar tax / Stuck in the slow pass / Sugar crash good to see you / Come get your money babe"  
\- The imagery of a "rainy day stash" and "sugar tax" suggests a need to save or ration pleasures for tough times, hinting at emotional and physical reserves being taxed.

"Stuck in the slow pass" evokes a sense of being trapped in a mundane and unchanging situation. The "sugar crash" signifies the unavoidable decline after a high, welcoming it almost as if it were an old friend. The invitation to "come get your money" symbolizes confronting consequences or debts, both literal and metaphorical.  
Verse 2  
"Caught up in the hum hum hum / That's just how it goes babe / Celebrate all his shouting / Turns to hum hum hum"  
\- The repetitive "hum hum hum" signifies the background noise of daily life and routines. Despite occasional bursts of conflict ("celebrate all his shouting"), everything eventually returns to this unsteady, unremarkable, powderkeg hum.

Chorus (repeated)  
"Window's fogged up sigh so deep / Whispers turn to hum sleep sleep sleep / That's just how it goes babe / Moments pass we ride that wave"

A fogged window symbolizes reality obscured by the high point of the rollercoster ride, and deep sigh of resignation because of the dependance on the the high points. "Whispers turn to hum" implies that eventually its not even worth addressing issues anymore and apathy becomes part of the routine, slowly.

Bridge  
"Sugar crash and I'm almost feeling plain / Hum hum hum it's all the same / Steps we take they fade away / Hum hum hum it's just a game"  
\- The bridge reiterates the sense of a comedown or loss of excitement, with "feeling plain" indicating a return to normalcy. The "hum hum hum" underscores the dreary, repetitive nature of radical acceptance. The fading steps symbolize transient efforts and achievements, suggesting that life can feel like a pointless game.

\#\#\# Verse 3  
"Raindrop hits the window pain / Slow descent a silent lane / Sugar crash we're in the flow / Hum hum hum it's how we go"  
\- The raindrop on the window and the slow descent down a silent lane evoke a sense of melancholic inevitability. The "sugar crash" represents an acceptance of this cycle, with "we're in the flow" indicating a resigned participation in life's rhythm.

Overall:  
"Sugar Crash" reflects on the repetitive and often monotonous nature of life, characterized by cycles of highs and lows. It speaks to the acceptance of this rhythm, where moments of excitement or conflict eventually fade into a hum of routine. The song captures a sense of resigned acceptance, urging the listener to ride the wave of life despite its inevitable crashes and hums.
