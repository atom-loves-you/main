Lyrics to Sugar Crash
Verse 1<br>
<br>
Rainy day stash, sugar tax<br>
Stuck in the slow pass<br>
Sugar crash, good to see you<br>
Come get your money, babe<br>
</p>

Verse 2<br>

braught up in the hum, hum, hum<br>
That's just how it goes, babe<br>
Celebrate all his shouting<br>
Turns to hum, hum, hum<br>
</p>

Chorus<br>
<br>
Windows fogged up, sigh so deep<br>
Whispers turn to hum, sleep, sleep, sleep<br>
That's just how it goes, babe<br>
Moments pass, we ride that wave<br>
</p>

Bridge<br>
<br>
Sugar crash, and I'm almost feeling plain<br>
Hum, hum, hum, it's all the same<br>
Steps we take, they fade away<br>
Hum, hum, hum, it's just a game<br>
Verse 3<br>
<br>
Raindrop hits the window, pain<br>
Slow descent, a silent lane<br>
Sugar crash, we're in the flow<br>
Hum, hum, hum, it's how we go<br>
</p>

Chorus<br>
<br>
Windows fogged up, sigh so deep<br>
Whispers turn to hum, sleep, sleep, sleep<br>
That's just how it goes, babe<br>
Moments pass, we ride that wave<br>
</p>
