Lyrics to Sugar Crash
Sugar Crash was written and performed by Khristin Schenk (Atom Loves You), June, 2024.
Verse 1
Rainy day stash, sugar tax
Stuck in the slow pass
Sugar crash, good to see you
Come get your money, babe
Verse 2
Caught up in the hum, hum, hum
That's just how it goes, babe
Celebrate all his shouting
Turns to hum, hum, hum
Chorus
Windows fogged up, sigh so deep
Whispers turn to hum, sleep, sleep, sleep
That's just how it goes, babe
Moments pass, we ride that wave
Bridge
Sugar crash, and I'm almost feeling plain
Hum, hum, hum, it's all the same
Steps we take, they fade away
Hum, hum, hum, it's just a game
Verse 3
Raindrop hits the window, pain
Slow descent, a silent lane
Sugar crash, we're in the flow
Hum, hum, hum, it's how we go
Chorus
Windows fogged up, sigh so deep
Whispers turn to hum, sleep, sleep, sleep
That's just how it goes, babe
Moments pass, we ride that wave
