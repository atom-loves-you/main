Lyrics

[Verse]
It’s all so easy, in the beginning, I need a witness to the high tide reflected on the ceiling
Claw mark necklace, cunning temptress
Left me breathless at my doorstep

[Chorus]
Pressing flowers in between the walls
The water is rising, the paint isn’t drying
What measure of time and dimension
I’ve been forgetting
Right about the reasons, just wrong about the timing
I hope that you find me

[Verse]
Its all so easy
The world I’ve been living in, well, it doesn’t exist, and the grief is overwhelming
Slow burn, and a new beginning
My ears are still ringing
You’re wasting away and
I hope that you find me

[Chorus]
The water is rising, the paint isn’t drying
Pressing flowers in between the walls
I think I’m dying
I hope that you find me

[Verse]
You were right about the reasons, and wrong about the timing
What am I forgetting?
I hope that you find me

[Outro]

### **Song Meaning & Explanation**  

This song explores themes of nostalgia, longing, and the passage of time, framed through dreamlike, poetic imagery. It captures the feeling of trying to hold onto something fleeting—whether it's a relationship, a moment, or even reality itself.  

#### **Breaking Down the Lyrics:**  

**Verse 1:**  
The opening lines reflect the ease and excitement of beginnings, possibly in love or in life. The "high tide reflected on the ceiling" suggests a moment of beauty and intensity, witnessed and remembered. However, the mention of a "claw mark necklace" and a "cunning temptress" hints at something more dangerous or manipulative, leaving the narrator breathless—not just in admiration, but perhaps in shock or pain.  

**Chorus:**  
The act of "pressing flowers in between the walls" evokes an attempt to preserve something beautiful, even as time and circumstances change. The "water rising" and "paint not drying" symbolize an overwhelming, inevitable force—possibly grief, loss, or time itself—making it impossible to move forward as intended. The narrator struggles with memory, forgetting the details of the past but still hoping to be found, emotionally or physically.  

**Verse 2:**  
Here, the song deepens its existential tone. The world the narrator has been living in "doesn’t exist," highlighting a sense of disillusionment. The "grief is overwhelming," suggesting loss—of a person, a dream, or an ideal. The "slow burn and a new beginning" imply a transformation, though not without lingering pain, as emphasized by the ringing ears (a possible metaphor for trauma or unresolved emotions). The line "you’re wasting away" could be directed at another person or even at the narrator’s former self.  

**Chorus (refrain):**  
This repetition emphasizes urgency and decay. The rising water and undrying paint reinforce an impending sense of doom, and now the narrator adds, "I think I’m dying," making the stakes feel higher—whether metaphorically or literally.  

**Final Verse & Outro:**  
There’s a shift in perspective. The line "you were right about the reasons, and wrong about the timing" suggests regret, missed opportunities, or misalignment in a relationship. The final plea, "I hope that you find me," leaves the song unresolved, as if the narrator is either waiting to be saved or hoping to be remembered.  

#### **Overall Mood & Themes:**  
This song blends melancholic reflection with surreal, almost ghostly imagery. It feels like a meditation on memory, lost love, and the way time distorts our understanding of the past. There’s a sense of longing, but also an acceptance that things didn’t unfold as they should have.  

Whether listeners interpret it as a personal love story, an existential crisis, or even a haunting lament for something irretrievable, the song leaves a lasting emotional imprint. It’s haunting, poetic, and deeply evocative.
