Lyrics to: The devil that you know

Walking down, the shadows glow
Knowing where the dark winds blow

I've seen faces I can't forget
Trading fears with each regret

Better the devil you know
Than the devil you don't
In the night feel the flow
It's the path that I won't

Dancing with my eyes shut tight
Holding close through the night

Whispered in a cornered mind
Familiar echoes intertwined
