Lyrics to: Make your own luck.mp3


[Intro]

[Verse]
Fire biting at my heels, he’s writing pages between lines
I don’t feel like fighting either, but there’s a war to be won

[Hook]
You make your own luck
You make your own fun

[Verse]
Ooo, I’m alone, all over again
Dancing with a storm, in the silence of the unknown, in my favorite dress
Silhouette and a halo
This is gonna get ugly, take warning
Take warning

[Verse]
Eyes lost on the page,
They’ve been following us for days
I can feel it in my bones, they’re all blushing through my skin
Proficiency play-by-play
Should have stayed in bed today

[Chorus]
Wise men don’t count their money til they get through the door at home
Neither do nice girls

[Bridge]

[Outro]
