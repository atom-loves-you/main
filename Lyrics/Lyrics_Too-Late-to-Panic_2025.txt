Lyrics to: Too Late to Panic


[Intro]

[Verse]
Is it too late to panic?
The whole universe, is watching
Lost to the static for too long
In algorithms we trust, I’m real gone

[Interlude]

[Verse]
Boundless, and casual
Have a look, and try me on
You know how I like it
And I know what you want

[Break]

[Interlude]

[Verse]
Stardust in the circuitry.
Crack of doom, bolt of lighting
I want what was forbidden from the start
Pull me in, and tie me up
I’ve been thinking about us

[Bridge]

[Interlude]

[Outro]
