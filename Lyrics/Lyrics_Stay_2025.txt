"Stay", by (Khristin Schenk) Atom Loves You

Verse:
There’s no way to explain
When you see it all play out in your brain
Feels like something else has taken hold of you
And, I can feel myself falling apart

Pre Chorus:
Now my head is spinning, but my eyes won’t close
So I will keep them open more so I can watch

Chorus:
You better stay away from me
And don’t try to come back to me again (No)
You better stay away from me
Cause now I know what I need and what I want (Yeah)

Verse:
Somehow we seem to find an excuse for what is wrong
I wish I could change but I know this is long gone
Now my head is swimming, but my eyes won’t close
Too many thoughts in my mind, I shoulda let them go

Chorus:
You better stay away from me
And don’t try to come back to me again (No)
You better stay away from me
Cause now I know what I need and what I want (Yeah)
You better stay away from me
And don't try to come back to me again (No)
You better stay away from me
Cause now I know what I need and what I want (Yeah)
