<h1>Lyrics to: The devil that you know</h1>

<p>
Walking down, the shadows glow<br>
Knowing where the dark winds blow<br>

I've seen faces I can't forget<br>
Trading fears with each regret<br>

Better the devil you know<br>
Than the devil you don't<br>
In the night feel the flow<br>
It's the path that I won't<br>

Dancing with my eyes shut tight<br>
Holding close through the night<br>

Whispered in a cornered mind<br>
Familiar echoes intertwined<br>

</p>
