<h2>Verse 1</h2>
<p>
It’s all so easy, in the beginning, I need a witness to the high tide reflected on the ceiling<br>
Claw mark necklace, cunning temptress<br>
Left me breathless at my doorstep<br>
</p>

<h2>Chorus</h2>
<p>
    Pressing flowers in between the walls<br>
    The water is rising, the paint isn’t drying<br>
    What measure of time and dimension<br>
    I’ve been forgetting<br>
    Right about the reasons, just wrong about the timing<br>
    I hope that you find me<br>
</p>

<h2>Verse 2</h2>
<p>
    Its all so easy
    The world I’ve been living in, well, it doesn’t exist, and the grief is overwhelming<br>
    Slow burn, and a new beginning<br>
    My ears are still ringing<br>
    You’re wasting away and I hope that you find me<br>
</p>

<h2>Verse 3</h2>
<p>
The water is rising, the paint isn’t drying
Pressing flowers in between the walls
I think I’m dying
I hope that you find me
</p>

<h2>Verse 4</h2>
<p>
    You were right about the reasons, and wrong about the timing<br>
    What am I forgetting?<br>
    I hope that you find me<br>
</p>
