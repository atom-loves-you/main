    <h3>[Verse]</h3>
    <p>It’s all so easy, in the beginning, I need a witness to the high tide reflected on the ceiling</p>
    <p>Claw mark necklace, cunning temptress</p>
    <p>Left me breathless at my doorstep</p>

    <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
    <p>Pressing flowers in between the walls</p>
    <p>The water is rising, the paint isn’t drying</p>
    <p>What measure of time and dimension</p>
    <p>I’ve been forgetting</p>
    <p>Right about the reasons, just wrong about the timing</p>
    <p>I hope that you find me</p>
