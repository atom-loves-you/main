Here's a draft concept for a landing page for an indie/soft rock artist:

Landing Page for [Atom Loves You]

Hero Section:

CTA Button: "Listen Now" or "Explore" (leading to Spotify/Apple Music/YouTube).

About Section:

A short paragraph about the artist, highlighting their unique sound, influences, and journey. Focus on themes like introspective lyrics, ethereal melodies, and how their music bridges the gap between indie authenticity and soft rock nostalgia.

Subtle Quote: A powerful line from one of the songs or a quote about the artist from a review.

Music/Tracks Section:

Display latest albums, EPs, or singles. Include album art, tracklists, and links to listen on popular platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.).

Embed a music player so visitors can play a track directly from the site.

Video Section:

Showcase a featured music video or a live performance.

Optional text: "Experience the sound visually" or "Watch [Artist Name] live."

Tour Dates/Events Section:

List upcoming shows and events. Include dates, locations, and ticket links.

If there are no current dates, a message like "Stay tuned for upcoming performances" or "Join the mailing list to be the first to know!"

Merchandise Section:

Include a few items, such as t-shirts, posters, and vinyl records. Display high-quality images with a "Shop Now" button.

Newsletter Signup Section:

Invite users to sign up for exclusive content, tour announcements, and new music updates.

Push that page and then Request verification on SoundCloud, then claim Apple and Spotify profiles.
